by
definition,
the
heart
is
a
muscular
organ
in
both
humans
and
other
animals,
which
pumps
blood
through
the
blood
vessels
of
the
circulatory
system.
blood
provides
the
body
with
oxygen
and
nutrients,
and
also
assists
in
the
removal
of
metabolic
wastes.
the
heart
is
located
in
the
middle
compartment
of
the
mediastinum
in
the
chest.
in
humans,
other
mammals
and
birds
the
heart
is
divided
into
four
chambers:
upper
left
and
right
atria;
and
lower
left
and
right
ventricles.
commonly
the
right
atrium
and
ventricle
are
referred
together
as
the
right
heart
and
their
left
counterparts
as
the
left
heart.
fish
in
contrast
have
two
chambers,
an
atrium
and
a
ventricle,
while
reptiles
have
three
chambers.
in
a
healthy
heart
blood
flows
one
way
through
the
heart
due
to
heart
valves,
which
prevent
backflow.
the
heart
is
enclosed
in
a
protective
sac,
the
pericardium,
which
also
contains
a
small
amount
of
fluid.
the
wall
of
the
heart
is
made
up
of
three
layers:
epicardium;
myocardium;
and
endocardium.
the
heart
pumps
blood
through
both
circulatory
systems.
blood
low
in
oxygen
from
the
systemic
circulation
enters
the
right
atrium
from
the
superior
and
inferior
vena
cavae
and
passes
to
the
right
ventricle.
from
here
it
is
pumped
into
the
pulmonary
circulation,
through
the
lungs
where
it
receives
oxygen
and
gives
off
carbon
dioxide.
oxygenated
blood
then
returns
to
the
left
atrium,
passes
through
the
left
ventricle
and
is
pumped
out
through
the
aorta
to
the
systemic
circulation−where
the
oxygen
is
used
and
metabolized
to
carbon
dioxide.
in
addition
the
blood
carries
nutrients
from
the
liver
and
gastrointestinal
tract
to
various
organs
of
the
body,
while
transporting
waste
to
the
liver
and
kidneys.
normally
with
each
heartbeat,
the
right
ventricle
pumps
the
same
amount
of
blood
into
the
lungs
as
the
left
ventricle
pumps
out
into
the
body.
veins
transport
blood
to
the
heart,
while
arteries
transport
blood
away
from
the
heart.
veins
normally
have
lower
pressures
than
arteries.
the
heart
contracts
at
a
rate
of
around
72
beats
per
minute,
at
rest.
exercise
temporarily
increases
this
rate,
but
lowers
resting
heart
rate
in
the
long
term,
and
is
good
for
heart
health.
cardiovascular
diseases
(cvd)
were
the
most
common
cause
of
death
globally
in
2008.
cvd
accounted
for
30%
of
death
cases
during
this
year
alone.
of
these
deaths
more
than
three
quarters
were
due
to
coronary
artery
disease
and
stroke.
risk
factors
include:
smoking,
being
overweight,
not
enough
exercise,
high
cholesterol,
high
blood
pressure,
and
poorly
controlled
diabetes
among
others.
diagnosis
of
cvd
is
often
done
by
listening
to
the
heart-sounds
with
a
stethoscope,
ecg
or
by
ultrasound.
diseases
of
the
heart
are
primarily
treated
by
cardiologists,
although
many
specialties
of
medicine
may
be
involved.
structure
the
heart
is
situated
in
the
middle
of
the
mediastinum
behind
the
breastbone
in
the
chest,
at
the
level
of
thoracic
vertebrae
t5-t8.
the
largest
part
of
the
heart
is
usually
slightly
offset
to
the
left
(though
occasionally
it
may
be
offset
to
the
right).
the
heart
is
usually
felt
to
be
on
the
left
side
because
the
left
heart
is
stronger,
since
it
pumps
to
all
body
parts.
the
left
lung
in
turn
is
smaller
than
the
right
lung
because
it
has
to
accommodate
the
heart.
the
heart
is
supplied
by
the
coronary
circulation
and
is
enclosed
in
the
pericardial
sac.
the
pericardium
encloses
the
heart
and
also
attaches
to
the
mediastinum
via
the
pericardiac
pleura,
providing
anchorage
for
the
heart.
the
back
surface
of
the
heart
lies
near
to
the
vertebral
column,
and
the
front
surface
sits
deep
to
the
sternum
and
costal
cartilages.
the
two
great
veins,
the
venae
cavae,
and
the
great
arteries,
the
aorta
and
pulmonary
trunk,
are
attached
to
the
upper
surface
of
the
heart,
called
the
base,
which
is
located
at
the
level
of
the
third
costal
cartilage.
the
lower
tip
of
the
heart,
the
apex,
lies
just
to
the
left
of
the
sternum
between
the
junction
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
ribs
near
their
articulation
with
the
costal
cartilages.
the
right
side
of
the
heart
is
deflected
forwards,
and
the
left
side
is
deflected
to
the
back.
the
shape
of
the
heart
is
similar
to
a
pinecone,
rather
broad
at
the
base
and
tapering
to
the
apex.
a
stethoscope
can
be
placed
directly
over
the
apex
so
that
the
beats
can
be
counted.
an
adult
heart
has
a
mass
of
250–350
grams
(9–12 oz).
the
heart
is
typically
the
size
of
a
fist:
12 cm
(5 in)
in
length,
8 cm
(3.5 in)
wide,
and
6 cm
(2.5 in)
in
thickness.
well-trained
athletes
can
have
much
larger
hearts
due
to
the
effects
of
exercise
on
the
heart
muscle,
similar
to
the
response
of
skeletal
muscle.
chambers
the
heart
has
four
chambers,
two
upper
atria,
the
receiving
chambers,
and
two
lower
ventricles,
the
discharging
chambers.
the
atria
are
connected
to
the
ventricles
by
the
atrioventricular
valves
and
they
are
separated
by
the
coronary
sulcus.
the
right
atrium
receives
deoxygenated
blood
from
the
body
and
the
left
atrium
receives
oxygenated
blood
from
the
lungs.
when
these
contract
the
blood
is
pushed
into
the
ventricles,
which
pump
to
propel
the
blood
to
the
lungs
and
the
rest
of
the
body.
there
is
an
ear-shaped
structure
in
the
upper
right
atrium
called
the
right
atrial
appendage,
or
auricle,
and
another
in
the
upper
left
atrium,
the
left
atrial
appendage.
the
right
atrium
and
the
right
ventricle
together
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
right
heart
and
this
sometimes
includes
the
pulmonary
trunk.
similarly,
the
left
atrium
and
the
left
ventricle
together
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
left
heart.
these
are
separated
by
the
posterior
interventricular
sulcus.
the
left
heart
pumps
to
the
systemic
circulation
and
the
right
heart
pumps
to
the
pulmonary
circulation.
the
cardiac
skeleton
is
made
of
dense
connective
tissue
as
collagen
and
this
gives
structure
to
the
heart
and
forms
the
atrioventricular
septum
which
separates
the
right
from
the
left
heart,
and
the
fibrous
rings
which
serve
as
bases
for
the
four
heart
valves.
the
cardiac
skeleton
also
provides
an
important
boundary
in
the
heart’s
electrical
conduction
system
since
collagen
cannot
conduct
electricity.
the
chordae
tendinae
attach
to
the
atrioventricular
valve
cusps.
the
interatrial
septum
separates
the
atria
and
the
interventricular
septum
separates
the
ventricles.
these
septa
(dividing
walls)
develop
from
the
myocardium
to
form
the
heart
chambers.
the
interventricular
septum
is
much
thicker
than
the
interatrial
septum,
since
the
ventricles
need
to
generate
greater
pressure
when
they
contract.
valves
all
four
heart
valves
lie
along
the
same
plane.
the
valves
ensure
unidirectional
blood
flow
through
the
heart
and
prevent
backflow.
between
the
right
atrium
and
the
right
ventricle
is
the
tricuspid
valve.
the
right
ventricle
receives
blood
from
the
right
atrium
through
the
tricuspid
valve.
this
consists
of
three
cusps
(flaps
or
leaflets),
made
of
endocardium
reinforced
with
additional
connective
tissue.
each
of
the
three
valve-cusps
is
attached
to
several
strands
of
connective
tissue,
the
chordae
tendineae
(tendinous
cords),
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
heart
strings.
they
are
composed
of
approximately
80
percent
collagenous
fibers
with
the
remainder
consisting
of
elastic
fibers
and
endothelium.
they
connect
each
of
the
cusps
to
a
papillary
muscle
that
extends
from
the
lower
ventricular
surface.
these
muscles
control
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
valves.
the
three
papillary
muscles
in
the
right
ventricle
are
called
the
anterior,
posterior,
and
septal
muscles,
which
correspond
to
the
three
positions
of
the
valve
cusps.
between
the
left
atrium
and
left
ventricle
is
the
mitral
valve,
also
known
as
the
bicuspid
valve
due
to
its
having
two
cusps,
an
anterior
and
a
posterior
medial
cusp.
these
cusps
are
also
attached
via
chordae
tendinae
to
two
papillary
muscles
projecting
from
the
ventricular
wall.
these
two
valves
are
the
atrioventricular
valves.
during
the
relaxation
phase
of
the
cardiac
cycle,
the
papillary
muscles
are
also
relaxed
and
the
tension
on
the
chordae
tendineae
is
slight.
however,
as
the
ventricle
contracts,
so
do
the
papillary
muscles.
this
creates
tension
on
the
chordae
tendineae,
helping
to
hold
the
cusps
of
the
atrioventricular
valves
in
place
and
preventing
them
from
being
blown
back
into
the
atria.
the
semilunar
pulmonary
valve
is
located
at
the
base
of
the
pulmonary
artery.
this
has
three
cusps
which
are
not
attached
to
any
papillary
muscles.
when
the
ventricle
relaxes
blood
flows
back
into
the
ventricle
from
the
artery
and
this
flow
of
blood
fills
the
pocket-like
valve,
pressing
against
the
cusps
which
close
to
seal
the
valve.
the
semilunar
aortic
valve
is
at
the
base
of
the
aorta
and
also
is
not
attached
to
papillary
muscles.
this
too
has
three
cusps
which
close
with
the
pressure
of
the
blood
flowing
back
from
the
aorta.

the
two
major
systemic
veins,
the
superior
and

and
the
collection
of
veins
that
make
up
the
coronary
sinus
which
drains
the
myocardium,
empty
into
the
right
atrium.
the
superior
vena
cava
drains
blood
from
above
the
diaphragm
and
empties
into
the
upper
back
part
of
the
right
atrium.
the
inferior
cava
drains
the
blood
from
below
the
diaphragm
and
empties
into
the
back
part
of
the
atrium
below
the
opening
for
the
superior
cava.
immediately
above
and
to
the
middle
of
the
opening
of
the
inferior
cava
is
the
opening
of
the
thin-walled,
coronary
sinus.
in
the
wall
of
the
right
atrium
is
an
oval-shaped
depression
known
as
the
fossa
ovalis,
which
is
a
remnant
of
an
opening
in
the
fetal
heart
known
as
the
foramen
ovale.
the
foramen
ovale
allowed
blood
in
the
fetal
heart
to
pass
directly
from
the
right
atrium
to
the
left
atrium,
allowing
some
blood
to
bypass
the
pulmonary
circuit.
within
seconds
after
birth,
a
flap
of
tissue
known
as
the
septum
primum
that
previously
acted
as
a
valve
closes
the
foramen
ovale
and
establishes
the
typical
cardiac
circulation
pattern.
most
of
the
internal
surface
of
the
right
atrium
is
smooth,
the
depression
of
the
fossa
ovalis
is
medial,
and
the
anterior
surface
has
prominent
ridges
of
pectinate
muscles,
which
are
also
present
in
the
right
atrial
appendage.
the
atria
receive
venous
blood
on
a
nearly
continuous
basis,
preventing
venous
flow
from
stopping
while
the
ventricles
are
contracting.
while
most
ventricular
filling
occurs
while
the
atria
are
relaxed,
they
do
demonstrate
a
contractile
phase
when
they
actively
pump
blood
into
the
ventricles
just
prior
to
ventricular
contraction.
the
right
atrium
is
connected
to
the
right
ventricle
by
the
tricuspid
valve.
when
the
myocardium
of
the
ventricle
contracts,
pressure
within
the
ventricular
chamber
rises.
blood,
like
any
fluid,
flows
from
higher
pressure
to
lower
pressure
areas,
in
this
case,
toward
the
pulmonary
trunk
and
the
atrium.
to
prevent
any
potential
backflow,
the
papillary
muscles
also
contract,
generating
tension
on
the
chordae
tendineae.
this
prevents
the
flaps
of
the
valves
from
being
forced
into
the
atria
and
regurgitation
of
the
blood
back
into
the
atria
during
ventricular
contraction.
the
walls
of
the
right
ventricle
are
lined
with
trabeculae
carneae,
ridges
of
cardiac
muscle
covered
by
endocardium.
in
addition
to
these
muscular
ridges,
a
band
of
cardiac
muscle,
also
covered
by
endocardium,
known
as
the
moderator
band
reinforces
the
thin
walls
of
the
right
ventricle
and
plays
a
crucial
role
in
cardiac
conduction.
it
arises
from
the
lower
part
of
the
interventricular
septum
and
crosses
the
interior
space
of
the
right
ventricle
to
connect
with
the
inferior
papillary
muscle.
when
the
right
ventricle
contracts,
it
ejects
blood
into
the
pulmonary
trunk,
which
branches
into
the
left
and
right
pulmonary
arteries
that
carry
it
to
each
lung.
the
upper
surface
of
the
right
ventricle
begins
to
taper
as
it
approaches
the
pulmonary
trunk.
at
the
base
of
the
pulmonary
trunk
is
the
pulmonary
semilunar
valve
that
prevents
backflow
from
the
pulmonary
trunk.

high
in

via
one
of
the
four
pulmonary
veins.
only
the
left
atrial
appendage
contains
pectinate
muscles.
blood
flows
nearly
continuously
from
the
pulmonary
veins
back
into
the
atrium,
which
acts
as
the
receiving
chamber,
and
from
here
through
an
opening
into
the
left
ventricle.
most
blood
flows
passively
into
the
heart
while
both
the
atria
and
ventricles
are
relaxed,
but
toward
the
end
of
the
ventricular
relaxation
period,
the
left
atrium
will
contract,
pumping
blood
into
the
ventricle.
this
atrial
contraction
accounts
for
approximately
20
percent
of
ventricular
filling.
the
left
atrium
is
connected
to
the
left
ventricle
by
the
mitral
valve.
although
both
sides
of
the
heart
will
pump
the
same
amount
of
blood,
the
muscular
layer
is
much
thicker
in
the
left
ventricle
compared
to
the
right,
due
to
the
greater
force
needed
here.
like
the
right
ventricle,
the
left
also
has
trabeculae
carneae,
but
there
is
no
moderator
band.
the
left
ventricle
is
the
major
pumping
chamber
for
the
systemic
circuit;
it
ejects
blood
into
the
aorta
through
the
aortic
semilunar
valve.
membranes,
surface
features,
and
layers
membranes
the
double
membrane
that
surrounds
the
heart
and
roots
of
the
great
vessels
is
called
the
pericardium
or
pericardial
sac.
the
pericardium,
(which
means
around
the
heart),
consists
of
two
layers:
the
outer
fibrous
pericardium
and
the
inner
serous
pericardium
and
these
enclose
the
pericardial
cavity.
the
fibrous
pericardium
is
made
of
tough,
dense
connective
tissue
that
protects
the
heart
and
maintains
its
position
in
the
thorax.
the
more
delicate
visceral
serous
pericardium
consists
of
two
layers:
the
parietal
pericardium,
which
is
fused
to
the
fibrous
pericardium,
and
an
inner
visceral
pericardium,
or
epicardium,
which
is
fused
to
the
heart
and
is
part
of
the
heart
wall.
the
pericardial
cavity,
filled
with
lubricating
serous
fluid,
lies
between
the
epicardium
and
the
pericardium.
in
most
internal
organs,
visceral
serous
membranes
are
microscopic.
however,
in
the
heart,
the
epicardium
is
macroscopic.
it
consists
of
a
simple
squamous
epithelium
called
mesothelium,
reinforced
with
loose,
irregular,
or
areolar
connective
tissue
that
attaches
to
the
pericardium.
this
mesothelium
secretes
the
pericardial
fluid
which
reduces
friction
as
the
heart
contracts.
it
also
enables
the
heart
to
move
in
response
to
the
movements
of
the
diaphragm
and
lungs.

inside
the
pericardium,

major
coronary
blood

are
located
in
these
sulci.
the
deep
coronary
sulcus
is
located
between
the
atria
and
ventricles.
between
the
left
and
right
ventricles
are
two
additional
sulci
that
are
not
as
deep
as
the
coronary
sulcus.
on
the
front
and
back
of
the
heart's

are
the
anterior

posterior
interventricular
sulci.
these
two
grooves
separate
the
ventricles.
layers
the
wall
of
the
heart
is
composed
of
three
layers.
from
outer
to
inner,
these
are
the
epicardium,
the
myocardium,
and
the
endocardium.
the
middle
and
thickest
layer
is
the
myocardium,
made
largely
of
cardiac
muscle
cells.
it
is
built
upon
a
framework
of
collagenous
fibers,
plus
the
blood
vessels
that
supply
the
myocardium
and
the
nerve
fibers
that
help
regulate
the
heart.
it
is
the
contraction
of
the
myocardium
that
pumps
blood
through
the
heart
and
into
the
major
arteries.
the
muscle
pattern
is
elegant
and
complex,
as
the
muscle
cells
swirl
and
spiral
around
the
chambers
of
the
heart.
they
form
a
figure
8
pattern
around
the
atria
and
around
the

development
the
heart
is
the
first
functional
organ
to
develop
and
starts
to
beat
and
pump
blood
at
about
three
weeks
into
embryogenesis.
this
early
start
is
crucial
for
subsequent
embryonic
and
prenatal
development.
the
heart
derives
from
splanchnopleuric
mesenchyme
in
the
neural
plate
which
forms
the
cardiogenic
region.
two
endocardial
tubes
form
here
that
fuse
to
form
a
primitive
heart
tube
known
as
the
tubular
heart.
this
quickly
differentiates
into
five
regions,
from
head
to
tail
-
the
truncus
arteriosus,
bulbus
cordis,
primitive
ventricle,
primitive
atrium,
and
the
sinus
venosus.
the
truncus
arteriosus
will
divide
to
form
the
aorta
and
pulmonary
artery;
the
bulbus
cordis
will
develop
into
the
right
ventricle;
the
primitive
ventricle
will
form
the
left
ventricle;
the
primitive
atrium
will
become
the
front
parts
of
the
left
and
right
atria
and
their
appendages,
and
the
sinus
venosus
will
develop
into
the
posterior
part
of
the
right
atrium,
the
sinoatrial
node
and
the
coronary
sinus.
initially,
all
venous
blood
flows
into
the
sinus
venosus,
and
contractions
propel
the
blood
from
the
sinus
venosus
to
the
truncus
arteriosus.
between
the
third
and
fourth
week,
the
heart
tube
lengthens,
and
begins
to
fold
to
form
an
s-shape
within
the
pericardium.
this
places
the

and

into
the
correct

for
the

further
development
will
include

and
remodelling
of
the
heart

by
the

the

are
complete

are
completed
by
the

begins
beating
at
around
22
days
after

(5
weeks

it
starts
to
beat
at
a
rate
near
to
the
mother’s
which
is
about
75–80
beats
per

(bpm).
the
embryonic
heart
rate
then
accelerates
linearly
by
approximately
3.3
bpm
every
day,
or
about
10
bpm
every
three
days,
which
gives
an
increase
of
100
bpm
during
the
first
month
which
peaks
at
165–185
bpm
early
in
the
early
7th

(early
9th

after

physiology
the
function
of
the
heart
involves
blood
flow;
myocardium
structure;
the
electrical
conduction
system
of
the
heart;
the
cardiac
cycle
and
cardiac
output.
blood
flow
the
heart
functions
as
a
pump
and
acts
as
a
double
pump
in
the
cardiovascular
system
to
provide
a
continuous
circulation
of
blood
throughout
the
body.
this
circulation
includes
the
systemic
circulation
and
the
pulmonary
circulation.
both
circuits
transport
blood
but
they
can
also
be
seen
in
terms
of
the
gases
they
carry.
the
pulmonary
circulation
collects
oxygen
from
the
lungs
and
delivers
carbon
dioxide
for
exhalation.the
systemic
circuit
transports
oxygen
to
the
body
and
returns
relatively
deoxygenated
blood
and
carbon
dioxide
to
the
pulmonary
circuit.
blood
flows
through
the
heart
in
one
direction,
from
the
atria
to
the
ventricles,
and
out
through
the
pulmonary
artery
into
the
pulmonary
circulation,
and
the
aorta
into
the
systemic
circulation.
the
pulmonary
artery
(also
trunk)
branches
into
the
left
and
right
pulmonary
arteries
to
supply
each
lung.
blood
is
prevented
from
flowing
backwards
(regurgitation)
by
the
tricuspid,
bicuspid,
aortic,
and
pulmonary
valves.
the
function
of
the
right
heart,
is
to
collect
de-oxygenated
blood,
in
the
right
atrium,
from
the
body
(via
the
superior
and
inferior
venae
cavae
and
pump
it,
through
the
tricuspid
valve,
via
the
right
ventricle,
through
the
semilunar
pulmonary
valve
and
into
the
pulmonary
artery
in
the
pulmonary
circulation
where
carbon
dioxide
can
be
exchanged
for
oxygen
in
the
lungs.this
happens
through
the
passive
process
of
diffusion.
in
the
left
heart
oxygenated
blood
is
returned
to
the
left
atrium
via
the
pulmonary
vein.
it
is
then
pumped
into
the
left
ventricle
through
the
bicuspid
valve
and
into
the
aorta
for
systemic
circulation.
eventually
in
the
systemic
capillaries

the
tissue
fluid
and
cells
of
the
body
occurs;
oxygen
and
nutrients
are
supplied
to
the
cells
for
their
metabolism
and
exchanged
for
carbon
dioxide
and
waste
products
in
this
case,
oxygen
and
nutrients
exit
the
systemic
capillaries
to
be
used
by
the
cells
in
their
metabolic
processes,
and
carbon
dioxide
and
waste
products
will
enter
the
blood.
the
ventricles
are
stronger

thicker
than
the
atria,
and
the
muscle
wall
surrounding
the
left
ventricle
is
thicker
than
the
wall
surrounding
the
right
ventricle
due
to
the
higher
force
needed
to
pump
the
blood
through
the
systemic

atria
facilitate
circulation
primarily
by
allowing
uninterrupted
venous
flow
to
the
heart,
preventing
the
inertia
of
interrupted
venous
flow
that
would
otherwise
occur
at
each

cardiac
muscle
cardiac
muscle
tissue
has
autorhythmicity,
the
unique
ability
to
initiate
a
cardiac
action
potential
at
a
fixed
rate
-
spreading
the
impulse
rapidly
from
cell
to
cell
to
trigger
the
contraction
of
the
entire
heart.
this
autorhythmicity
is
still
modulated
by
the
endocrine
and
nervous
systems.
there
are
two
types
of
cardiac

cell:
cardiomyocytes
which
have
the
ability
to
contract
easily,
and
modified
cardiomyocytes
the
pacemaker
cells
of
the
conducting
system.
the
cardiomyocytes
make
up
the
bulk
(99%)
of
cells
in
the
atria
and
ventricles.
these
contractile
cells
respond
to
impulses
of
action
potential
from
the
pacemaker
cells
and
are
responsible
for
the
contractions
that
pump
blood
through
the
body.
the
pacemaker
cells
make
up
just
(1%
of
cells)
and
form
the
conduction
system
of
the
heart.
they
are
generally
much
smaller
than
the
contractile
cells
and
have
few
of
the
myofibrils
or
myofilaments
which
means
that
have
limited
contractibility.
their
function
is
similar
in
many
respects
to
neurons.

way,
but
bachmann's
bundle
and
coronary
sinus
muscle
play
a
role
in
conduction
between
the
two
atria,
which
have
a
nearly
simultaneous
systole.
while
in
the
ventricles,
the
signal
is
carried
by
specialized
tissue
called
the
purkinje
fibers
which
then
transmit
the
electric
charge
to
the
myocardium.
if
embryonic
heart
cells
are
separated
into
a
petri
dish
and
kept
alive,
each
is
capable
of
generating
its
own
electrical
impulse
followed
by
contraction.
when
two
independently
beating
embryonic
cardiac
muscle
cells
are
placed
together,
the
cell
with
the
higher
inherent
rate
sets
the
pace,
and
the
impulse
spreads
from
the
faster
to
the
slower
cell
to
trigger
a
contraction.
as
more
cells
are
joined
together,
the

a
fully
developed
adult
heart
maintains
the
capability
of
generating
its
own
electrical
impulse,
triggered
by
the
fastest
cells,
as
part
of
the
cardiac
conduction
system.
the
components
of
the
cardiac
conduction
system
include
the
atrial
and
ventricular
syncytium,
the
sinoatrial
node,
the
atrioventricular

and
the

sinoatrial
(sa)
node
normal
sinus
rhythm
is
established
by
the
sinoatrial
(sa)
node,
the
heart's
pacemaker.
the
sa
node
is
a
specialized
grouping
of
cardiomyocytes
in
the
upper
and
back
walls
of
the
right
atrium
very
close
to
the
opening
of
the
superior
vena
cava.
the
sa
node
has
the
highest
rate
of
depolarization.
the
atrioventricular
(av)
node
is
a
second
cluster
of
specialized
myocardial
conductive
cells,
located
in
the
inferior
portion
of
the
right
atrium
within
the
atrioventricular
septum.
the
septum
prevents
the
impulse
from
spreading
directly
to
the
ventricles
without
passing
through
the
av
node.
there
is
a
critical
pause
before
the
av
node
depolarizes
and
transmits
the
impulse
to
the
atrioventricular
bundle.
this
delay
in
transmission
is
partially
attributable
to
the
small
diameter
of
the
cells
of
the
node,
which
slow
the
impulse.
also,

is
less

than
between

are
considerably
different
between
conductive
and

while
sodium

and
potassium
k+
ions
play
essential
roles,
calcium
ions
ca2+
are
also
critical
for
both
types
of
cell.
unlike
skeletal
muscles
and
neurons,
cardiac
conductive
cells
do
not
have
a
stable
resting
potential.
conductive
cells
contain
a
series
of
sodium
ion
channels
that
allow
a
normal
and
slow
influx
of
sodium
ions
that
causes
the
membrane
potential
to
rise
slowly
from
an
initial
value
of
−60
mv
up
to
about
–40
mv.
the
resulting
movement
of
sodium
ions
creates
spontaneous
depolarization
(or
prepotential
depolarization).
at
this
point,
calcium
channels
open
and
ca2+
enters
the
cell,
further
depolarizing
it
at
a
more
rapid
rate
until
it
reaches
a
value
of
approximately
+5
mv.
at
this
point,
the
calcium
ion
channels
close
and
potassium
channels
open,
allowing
outflux
of
k+
and
resulting
in
repolarization.
when
the
membrane
potential
reaches
approximately
−60
mv,
the
k+
channels
close
and
na+
channels
open,
and
the
prepotential
phase
begins
again.
this
process
gives
the
autorhythmicity
to

approximately
20
percent
of
the

supplied
by
the
influx
of

in
the
sa

and
a
few
other
conductive
cells
in
the

the
sa
node,
without
nervous
or
endocrine
control,
would
initiate
a
heart
impulse
approximately
80–100
times
per
minute.
although
each
component
of
the
conduction
system
is
capable
of
generating
its
own
impulse,
the
rate
progressively
slows
from
the
sa
node
to
the
purkinje
fibers.
without
the
sa
node,
the
av
node
would
generate
a
heart
rate
of
40–60
beats
per
minute.
if
the
av
node
were
blocked,
the
atrioventricular
bundle
would
fire
at
a
rate
of
approximately
30–40
impulses
per
minute.
the
bundle
branches
would
have
an
inherent
rate
of
20–30
impulses
per
minute,
and
the
purkinje
fibers
would
fire
at
15–20
impulses
per

while
a
few
exceptionally
trained
aerobic
athletes
demonstrate
resting
heart
rates
in
the
range
of
30–40
beats
per
minute
(the

for

most
individuals,
rates
lower
than
50

would
indicate
a
condition
called
bradycardia.
depending
upon
the
specific
individual,
as
rates
fall
much
below
this
level,
the
heart
would
be
unable

maintain
adequate

the
period
of

that

known
as
the

the
period
of

while
it

is
called

the

accordingly,
when

relaxed
(diastole),
blood
will
flow
into
the
atria
from
the
higher
pressure
of
the

as

flows
into
the
atria,
the

the

systole
and
diastole
contraction
of
the
atria
follows
depolarization,
represented
by
the
p
wave
of
the
ecg.
as
the
atrial
muscles
contract
from
the
superior
portion
of
the
atria
toward
the
atrioventricular
septum,
pressure
rises
within
the
atria
and
blood
is
pumped
into
the
ventricles
through
the
open
atrioventricular
(tricuspid,
and
mitral
or
bicuspid)
valves.
at
the
start
of
atrial
systole,
the
ventricles
are
normally
filled
with
approximately
70–80
percent
of
their
capacity
due
to
inflow
during
diastole.
atrial
contraction,
also
referred
to
as
the
"atrial
kick,"
contributes
the
remaining
20–30
percent
of
filling.
atrial
systole
lasts
approximately
100
ms
and
ends
prior
to
ventricular
systole,
as
the
atrial
muscle
returns
to
diastole.
heart
sounds
one
of
the
simplest
methods
of
assessing
the
heart's
condition
is
to
listen
to
it
using
a
stethoscope.
in
a
healthy
heart,
there
are
only
two
audible
heart
sounds,
called
s1
and
s2.
the
first
heart
sound
s1,
is
the
sound
created
by
the
closing
of
the
atrioventricular
valves
during
ventricular
contraction
and
is
normally
described
as
"lub".
the
second
heart
sound,
s2,
is
the
sound
of
the
semilunar
valves
closing
during
ventricular
diastole
and
is
described
as
"dub".
each
sound
consists
of
two
components,
reflecting
the
slight
difference
in
time
as
the
two
valves
close.
s2
may
split
into
two
distinct
sounds,
either
as
a
result
of
inspiration
or
different
valvular
or
cardiac
problems.
additional
heart
sounds
may
also
be
present
and
these
give
rise
to
gallop
rhythms.
a
third
heart
sound,
s3
usually
indicates
an
increase
in
ventricular
blood
volume.
a
fourth
heart
sound
s4
is
referred
to
as
an
atrial
gallop
and
is
produced
by
the
sound
of
blood
being
forced
into
a
stiff
ventricle.
the
combined
presence
of
s3
and
s4
give
a
quadruple
gallop.
heart
murmurs
are
abnormal
heart
sounds
which
can
be
either
pathological
or
benign
and
there
are
numerous
kinds.
murmurs
are
graded
by
volume,
from
1)
the
quietest,
to
6)
the
loudest,
and
evaluated
by
their
relationship
to
the
heart
sounds
and
position
in
the
cardiac
cycle.
phonocardiograms
can
record
these
sounds.
murmurs
can
result
from
narrowing
(stenosis),
regurgitation
or
insufficiency
of
any
of
the
main
heart
valves
but
they
can
also
result
from
a
number
of
other
disorders,
including
atrial
and
ventricular
septal
defects.
one
example
of
a
murmur
is
still's
murmur,
which
presents
a
musical
sound
in
children,
has
no
symptoms
and
disappears
in
adolescence.
a
different
type
of
sound,
a
pericardial
friction
rub
can
be
heard
in
cases
of
pericarditis
where
the
inflamed
membranes
can
rub
together.
heart
rate
the
resting
heart
rate
of
a
newborn
can
be
120
beats
per
minute
(bpm)
and
this
gradually
decreases
until
maturity
and
then
gradually
increases
again
with
age.
the
adult
resting
heart
rate
ranges
from
60-100
bpm.
exercise
and
fitness
levels,
age
and
basal
metabolic
rate
can
all
affect
the
heart
rate.
an
athlete’s
heart
rate
can
be
lower
than
60bpm.
during
exercise
the
rate
can
be
150bpm
with
maximum
rates
reaching
from
200
and
220
bpm.
cardiovascular
centres
the
normal
sinus
rhythm
of
the
heart
rate
is
generated
by
the
sa
node.
it
is
also
influenced
by
central
factors
through
sympathetic
and
parasympathetic
nerves
of
the
two
paired
cardiovascular
centres
of
the
medulla
oblongata.
activity
is
increased
via
sympathetic
stimulation
of
the
cardioaccelerator
nerves,
and
inhibited
via
parasympathetic
stimulation
by
the
vagus
nerve.
during
rest
vagal
stimulation
normally
predominates
as,
left
unregulated,
the
sa
node
would
initiate
a
sinus
rhythm
of
approximately
100
bpm.
both
sympathetic
and
parasympathetic
stimuli
flow
through
the
paired
cardiac
plexus
near
the
base
of
the
heart.
without
any
nervous
stimulation,
the
sa
node
would
establish
a
sinus
rhythm
of
approximately
100
bpm.
since
resting
rates
are
considerably
less
than
this,
it
becomes
evident
that
parasympathetic
stimulation
normally
slows
hr.
the
cardioaccelerator
center
also
sends
additional
fibers,
forming
the
cardiac
nerves
via
sympathetic
ganglia
(the
cervical
ganglia
plus
superior
thoracic
ganglia
t1–t4)
to
both
the
sa
and
av
nodes,
plus
additional
fibers
to
the
atria
and
ventricles.
the
ventricles
are
more
richly
innervated
by
sympathetic
fibers
than
parasympathetic
fibers.
sympathetic
stimulation
causes
the
release
of
the
neurotransmitter
norepinephrine
(also
known
as
noradrenaline)
at
the
neuromuscular
junction
of
the
cardiac
nerves.
this
shortens
the
repolarization
period,
thus
speeding
the
rate
of
depolarization
and
contraction,
which
results
in
an
increased
heartrate.
it
opens
chemical
or
ligand-gated
sodium
and
calcium
ion
channels,
allowing
an
influx
of
positively
charged
ions.
norepinephrine
binds
to
the
beta–1
receptor.
high
blood
pressure
medications
are
used
to
block
these
receptors
and
so
reduce
the
heart
rate.
the
cardiovascular
centres
receive
input
from
a
series
of
visceral
receptors
with
impulses
traveling
through
visceral
sensory
fibers
within
the
vagus
and
sympathetic
nerves
via
the
cardiac
plexus.
among
these
receptors
are
various
proprioreceptors,
baroreceptors,
and
chemoreceptors,
plus
stimuli
from
the
limbic
system
which
normally
enable
the
precise
regulation
of
heart
function,
via
cardiac
reflexes.
increased
physical
activity
results
in
increased
rates
of
firing
by
various
proprioreceptors
located
in
muscles,
joint
capsules,
and
tendons.
the
cardiovascular
centres
monitor
these
increased
rates
of
firing,
suppressing
parasympathetic
stimulation
or
increasing
sympathetic
stimulation
as
needed
in
order
to
increase
blood
flow.
similarly,
baroreceptors
are
stretch
receptors
located
in
the
aortic
sinus,
carotid
bodies,
the
venae
cavae,
and
other
locations,
including
pulmonary
vessels
and
the
right
side
of
the
heart
itself.
rates
of
firing
from
the
baroreceptors
represent
blood
pressure,
level
of
physical
activity,
and
the
relative
distribution
of
blood.
the
cardiac
centers
monitor
baroreceptor
firing
to
maintain
cardiac
homeostasis,
a
mechanism
called
the
baroreceptor
reflex.
with
increased
pressure
and
stretch,
the
rate
of
baroreceptor
firing
increases,
and
the
cardiac
centers
decrease
sympathetic
stimulation
and
increase
parasympathetic
stimulation.
as
pressure
and
stretch
decrease,
the
rate
of
baroreceptor
firing
decreases,
and
the
cardiac
centers
increase
sympathetic
stimulation
and
decrease
parasympathetic
stimulation.
there
is
a
similar
reflex,
called
the
atrial
reflex
or
bainbridge
reflex,
associated
with
varying
rates
of
blood
flow
to
the
atria.
increased
venous
return
stretches
the
walls
of
the
atria
where
specialized
baroreceptors
are
located.
however,
as
the
atrial
baroreceptors
increase
their
rate
of
firing
and
as
they
stretch
due
to
the
increased
blood
pressure,
the
cardiac
center
responds
by
increasing
sympathetic
stimulation
and
inhibiting
parasympathetic
stimulation
to
increase
hr.
the
opposite
is
also
true.
factors
influencing
heart
rate
in
addition
to
the
autonomic
nervous
system,
other
factors
can
impact
on
this.
these
include
epinephrine,
norepinephrine,
and
thyroid
hormones;
levels
of
various
ions
including
calcium,
potassium,
and
sodium;
body
temperature;
hypoxia;
and
ph
balance
.
factors
that
increase
heart
rate
also
trigger
an
increase
in
stroke
volume.
as
with
skeletal
muscles
the
heart
can
increase
in
size
and
efficiency
with
exercise.
thus
endurance
athletes
such
as
marathon
runners
may
have
a
heart
that
has
hypertrophied
by
up
to
40%.
the
difference
between
maximum
and
minimum
cardiac
outputs
is
known
as
the
cardiac
reserve
and
this
measures
the
residual
capacity
to
pump
blood.
heart
rates
may
reach
up
to
185-195
in
exercise,
depending
on
how
fit
a
person
is.
cardiac
output
cardiac
output
(co)
is
a
measurement
of
the
amount
of
blood
pumped
by
each
ventricle
(stroke
volume,
sv)
in
one
minute.
to
calculate
this,
multiply
stroke
volume
(sv),
by
heart
rate
(hr),
in
beats
per
minute.
it
can
be
represented
by
the
equation:
co
=
hr
x
sv
sv
is
normally
measured
using
an
echocardiogram
to
record
end
diastolic
volume
(edv)
and
end
systolic
volume
(esv),
and
calculating
the
difference:
sv
=
edv
–
esv.
sv
can
also
be
measured
using
a
specialized
catheter,
but
this
is
an
invasive
procedure
and
far
more
dangerous
to
the
patient.
a
mean
sv
for
a
resting
70-kg
(150-lb)
individual
would
be
approximately
70
ml.
there
are
several
important
variables,
including
size
of
the
heart,
physical
and
mental
condition
of
the
individual,
sex,
contractility,
duration
of
contraction,
preload
or
edv,
and
afterload
or
resistance.
normal
range
for
sv
would
be
55–100
ml.
an
average
resting
hr
would
be
approximately
75
bpm
but
could
range
from
60–100
in
some
individuals.
using
these
numbers,
(which
refer
to
each
ventricle,
not
both)
the
mean
co
is
5.25
l/min,
with
a
range
of
4.0–8.0
l/min.
svs
are
also
used
to
calculate
ejection
fraction,
which
is
the
portion
of
the
blood
that
is
pumped
or
ejected
from
the
heart
with
each
contraction.
to
calculate
ejection
fraction,
sv
is
divided
by
edv.
despite
the
name,
the
ejection
fraction
is
normally
expressed
as
a
percentage.
ejection
fractions
range
from
approximately
55–70
percent,
with
a
mean
of
58
percent.
stroke
volume
many
of
the
factors
that
regulate
the
heart
rate
also
have
an
impact
on
cardiac
function
by
altering
the
stroke
volume.
while
a
number
of
variables
are
involved,
stroke
volume
is
dependent
upon
the
difference
between
end
diastolic
volume
and
end
systolic
volume.
the
three
primary
factors
involved
are
preload,
afterload
and
contractility.
preload
preload
is
another
way
of
expressing
edv.
therefore,
the
greater
the
edv,
the
greater
the
preload.
a
main
factor
is
ventricular
filling
time.
the
faster
the
contractions
are,
the
shorter
the
filling
time
and
both
the
edv
and
preload
are
lower.
the
relationship
between
ventricular
stretch
and
contraction
has
been
stated
in
the
frank-starling
mechanism
which
says
that
the
force
of
contraction
is
directly
proportional
to
the
initial
length
of
muscle
fibre.
so
that
the
greater
the
stretch
of
the
ventricle
the
greater
the
contraction.
any
sympathetic
stimulation
to
the
venous
system
will
increase
venous
return
to
the
heart
and
ventricular
filling.
afterload
the
ventricles
must
develop
a
certain
tension
to
pump
blood
against
the
resistance
of
the
vascular
system.
this
tension
is
called
afterload.
when
the
resistance
is
increased
particularly
due
to
stenotic
valve
damage
the
afterload
must
necessarily
increase.
a
decrease
in
normal
vascular
resistance
can
also
occur.
different
cardiac
responses
operate
to
restore
homeostasis
of
the
pressure
and
blood
flow.
contractility
the
ability
of
the
myocardium
to
contract,
(its
contractility),
controls
the
stroke
volume
which
determines
the
end
systolic
volume.
the
greater
the
contraction
the
greater
the
stroke
volume
and
the
smaller
the
end
systolic
volume.
positive
or
negative
inotropic
factors
via
sympathetic
and
parasympathetic
stimulation
respectively,
can
increase
or
decrease
the
force
of
contractions.
sympathetic
stimulation
triggers
the
release
of
norepinephrine
from
the
cardiac
nerves
and
also
stimulates
the
adrenal
cortex
to
secrete
both
epinephrine
and
norepinephrine.
these
secretions
increase
the
heart
rate,
subsequent
metabolic
rate
and
contractility.
parasympathetic
stimulation
stimulates
the
release
of
acetylcholine
(ach)
from
the
vagus
nerve
which
decreases
contractility,
and
stroke
volume
which
increases
end
systolic
volume.
several
synthetic
drugs
have
been
developed
that
can
act
either
as
a
stimulant
or
inhibitor
inotrope.
the
stimulant
inotropes,
such
as
digoxin,
cause
higher
concentrations
of
calcium
ions
which
increase
contractility.
excess
calcium
(hypercalcemia)
is
also
a
positive
inotrope.
drugs
that
are
negative
inotropes
include
beta
blockers
and
calcium
channel
blockers.
hypoxia,
acidosis,
hyperkalemia
are
also
negative
inotropic
agents.
