wikipedia-access-thru-API

In the file pure_python_version, a wikipedia article is accessed through the Wikipedia API and the plain text of the article is subsequently filtered out. This is done using the Python programming language.

In the file bash_version, the same process is completed, albeit through different means using Bash scripts.

Data.txt is an obsolete file and is present for the sake of being there (the file data.txt is referred to in both files(python and bash) and thus is placed in the repository).
