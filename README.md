wikipedia-access-thru-API

Summary
=====

  This module retrieves articles from Wikipedia. It then extracts the text from those articles and readies that text for deeper linguistic analysis by 

   - [ ] removing stopwords
   - [ ] ignoring case 
   - [ ] lemmatizing words
 
 The module then performs latent Dirichlet allocation to identify the probability distributions of words that underly each article.

Motivation
====

 This module explores whether a computable representation of illness can be created from online content and how these representations differ from those created from traditional sources of medical knowledge. Combining these two may help to dispel misinformation in online content and update archaic descriptions of ilnesses. 


In the file pure_python_version, a wikipedia article is accessed through the Wikipedia API and the plain text of the article is subsequently filtered out. This is done using the Python programming language.

In the file bash_version, the same process is completed, albeit through different means using Bash scripts.

Data.txt is an obsolete file and is present for the sake of being there (the file data.txt is referred to in both files(python and bash) and thus is placed in the repository).

Details will be added once the files are complete.
